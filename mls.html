      This specification documents the use of Messaging Layer Security (MLS) over the ActivityPub protocol. MLS is a protocol for end-to-end encryption of group messaging. ActivityPub is a federated social networking protocol. This specification describes how to use MLS to encrypt messages sent over ActivityPub.

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>ActivityPub supports a number of different addressing modes for content that an actor publishes -- either public content addressed to the <code>mls:Public</code> collection, or semi-private content addressed to a collection such as the actor's followers. Content can also be addressed to other actors specifically; this provides a <em>direct messaging</em> feature in the protocol.</p>
    <aside class="example">
      <p>A <code>Note</code> object addressed from one actor to another.</p>

    <p>
      User expectations are that direct messages are only readable by the addressed actor(s). The topology of the ActivityPub network, however, introduces several intermediate entities between the sender and the receiver. In particular, the sender's ActivityPub server and the receiver's ActivityPub server receive and store copies of the content. If these servers are operated by entities other than the actor, those entities can inspect the contents of the direct messages, pursuant to the privacy agreement between the user and their server operator.
    </p>
    <p>
      The goals of this specification are to provide an additional level of privacy for the sender and receiver of the direct message, such that intermediaries cannot inspect the contents of the message. Called <dfn>end-to-end encrypted</dfn> or <dfn>E2EE</dfn> messaging, this pattern uses <dfn>public-key encryption</dfn> so that encrypted messages can be sent between actors using publicly-available keys, and decrypted with a corresponding private key available only to the actor. The message is encrypted on the sender's ActivityPub client, and decrypted on the receiver's ActivityPub client. No intermediary has access to the recipient's private key.
    </p>
    <section>
      <h3>User stories</h3>
      <p>These are the motivating user stories for this specification.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>As an ActivityPub user, I can send an encrypted DM to another user without anyone else being able to read it, so that our conversation is private.</strong> (Private messages)</li>
        <li><strong>As an ActivityPub user, I can send an encrypted message to 2 or more people, so that we can have private group conversations.</strong> (Group messages)</li>
        <li><strong>As an ActivityPub user, I can read my conversation history with another user, so that I can be reminded of what we said before.</strong> (Message history)</li>
        <li><strong>As an ActivityPub user, I can attach an encrypted image, video or audio file to my encrypted DM, so that we can communicate privately with different media.</strong> (Attachments)</li>
        <li><strong>As an ActivityPub user, I can start a conversation on my desktop computer and move over to my mobile device, so that I can have ubiquitous conversations.</strong> (Multiple clients)</li>
        <li><strong>As an ActivityPub user, I can send an encrypted DM to someone using a different platform, so I don’t have to maintain different accounts for different platforms.</strong> (Cross-platform)</li>
        <li><strong>As an ActivityPub user, I can block an encrypted DM from someone I don’t know, so I don’t get unsolicited messages.</strong> (DM only from people I know)</li>
        <li><strong>As an ActivityPub user, I can send encrypted DMs to someone just by their Webfinger ID (username@domain), so I don’t need extra addressing to send DMs.</strong> (No external identity)</li>
        <li><strong>As an ActivityPub user, I can send encrypted messages through a bridge to users on siloed social networks, so that we can communicate across protocols.</strong> (Bridgeable)</li>
        <li><strong>As an ActivityPub user, I can delete an encrypted DM, so that I can take back something I wish I hadn’t said.</strong> (Deletable)</li>
        <li><strong>As an ActivityPub user, I can confirm that the conversation I’m in is truly end-to-end encrypted and that no intermediate man-in-the-middle has access to the contents, so I and my correspondent can use untrusted servers.</strong> (Verifiable)</li>
        <li><strong>As an ActivityPub user, I can move my DMs to another server, so I can maintain data portability.</strong> (Message portability)</li>
        <li><strong>As an ActivityPub user, I can create an encrypted DM with a third-party client, so that I don’t have to depend on the server provider, and so that I know that the server provider isn’t snooping.</strong> (Third-party clients)</li>
        <li><strong>As an ActivityPub user, I can revoke a device or client from my account, so I can stop any further DMs being viewable on the client if it has fallen into the wrong hands or if I decide they are not trustworthy.</strong> (Revoke a client)</li>
        <li><strong>As an ActivityPub user, I want to use a web-based client, so that I don't have to install any software to send messages.</strong> (Web client)</li>
        <li><strong>As an ActivityPub user, I don't want to be responsible for managing my encryption keys, because I don't have to do that with other E2EE messaging systems, and it's so easy to make mistakes.</strong> (no manual key management)</li>
      </ul>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h3>Non-goals</h3>
      <p>For clarity, these goals are explicitly excluded from this specification. Implementers MAY use other techniques to ensure these goals.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Encrypted metadata</strong>. Addressing, identity, and typing metadata are required for delivery through the ActivityPub network.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Server-side content filtering</strong>. Because the contents are encrypted, servers cannot filter activities or objects based on their content. Clients may filter content after decryption.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Disappearing messages.</strong>. Some end-to-end encrypted messaging systems allow messages to be automatically deleted after a certain time. This is not implemented in the current specification, but the specification is not incompatible with such a feature.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Easy implementation</strong>. The specification used here is based on the MLS protocol, which is a complex protocol with many moving parts. Implementers should consider using libraries or platforms that support MLS to ensure proper implementation.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>E2EE for arbitrary activities.</strong> This specification is targeted primarily to text-based messaging with or without attachments. Other activities, such as "Like" or "Follow", are not covered by this specification.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>E2EE broadcast</strong>. This specification is targeted primarily to one-to-one or one-to-many messaging. Broadcast distribution, as is common on social networks, is not covered by this specification.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Push API.</strong> ActivityPub does not provide an API structure to push activities or content objects from the server to a connected client. Clients must poll the server for new content. Although push notifications are very useful for real-time messaging, this specification does not extend the ActivityPub API to provide them.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h3>Architecture</h3>
      <p>
        There are several models for integrating E2EE messaging into ActivityPub. Several were considered by the SocialCG, as detailed in the <a href="https://swicg.github.io/activitypub-e2ee/integration-models">Integration Models</a> document. The model chosen uses an abstract E2EE messaging protocol layered over ActivityPub using the ActivityPub API (client-to-server) and ActivityPub protocol (server-to-server) as the transport.
      </p>
      <p>
        Multiple abstract E2EE messaging protocols were considered, as detailed in the <a href="https://swicg.github.io/activitypub-e2ee/abstract-protocols">Abstract Protocols</a> document. The protocol that most closely matched the technical and intellectual property requirements of the SocialCG was the <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-mls-protocol/">Messaging Layer Security (MLS) protocol</a>. MLS is a protocol for end-to-end encryption of group messaging, and is designed to be secure, efficient, and scalable.
      </p>
      <p>
        To implement the MLS protocol over ActivityPub, this specification provides the following extensions to the ActivityPub and Activity Streams 2.0 vocabulary:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>A property of the actor to allow discovering all the public keys of all of the actor's clients.
        </li>
        <li>A property of the actor to allow reading all of the actor's incoming and outgoing messages that have been created with this protocol.
        </li>
        <li>A set of object types and properties that map directly to the data types defined by the MLS protocol.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This document does not specify the details of the MLS protocol, which are defined in <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc9420/">RFC 9420</a>. Implementers should refer to that document for the details of the protocol.

    <h2>Context</h2>
    <p>
      The terms in this document are defined in a context document that can be used in [[JSON-LD]] documents. The
